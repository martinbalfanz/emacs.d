#+TITLE: .emacs.d

This is my emacs config, rewritten.

* Setup

Clone this repository to =~/.emacs.d=:

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/martinbalfanz/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then, copy and adjust =example-dot-emacs= to =~/.emacs=.

The configuration will try to install required system packages.  If
you want to disable this set
=mb/use-package-allow-ensure-system-package= to nil.
