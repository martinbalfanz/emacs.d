#+TITLE: .emacs.d

This is my emacs config, rewritten. Currently based on [[http://spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Steve Purcell's emacs.d]].

* Setup

Clone spacemacs into it's default location:

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then, clone my repository into ~/.spacemacs.d

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/martinbalfanz/emacs.d.git ~/.spacemacs.d
#+END_SRC
